I'm particularly interested in your take on Omega Energia's recent earnings report \u2013  how does that impact their valuation in the current deal?  Also, Adidas's performance in the Asian market is a key concern for me;  what's your assessment of their growth trajectory there, considering the ongoing negotiations?"
