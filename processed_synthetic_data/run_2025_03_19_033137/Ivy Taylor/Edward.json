Their Q3 results were slightly below expectations, primarily due to softer-than-anticipated demand in certain segments.  There's some concern about the impact of macroeconomic headwinds."

However, we're seeing some interesting movement in specific companies.  Remitly Global (RELY) has shown promising upward trends recently, potentially driven by increased cross-border transaction volumes.  Conversely, Iberdrola (IBE.MC) is experiencing some volatility, likely influenced by recent regulatory changes in the renewable energy sector in Spain.  What are your initial thoughts and which company are you more interested in discussing today?"

I'm also keen to understand how their performance compares to Grab Holdings (GRAB), given their contrasting business models and exposure to different macroeconomic factors.  GRAB's earnings showed a significant increase in revenue, but profitability remains a concern.  Their expansion into financial services is a key driver of growth, but also carries considerable risk.  The competitive landscape in Southeast Asia is intense, and regulatory changes could significantly impact their operations.  How do you see these two companies performing in the coming quarters, considering the global economic uncertainty and potential shifts in energy demand and digital adoption rates?  What are the key risks and opportunities you foresee for each?"
