Their recent earnings report highlighted significant growth in offshore wind energy, but I'm concerned about the impact of rising interest rates on their future projects and overall profitability.  Could you elaborate on your assessment of their financial health and future projections, considering the current macroeconomic climate and the challenges they face in securing financing for large-scale projects?"

Offshore wind revenue growth was indeed robust, driven by successful project completions and strong demand. However, the increased interest rate environment is a valid concern.  Their debt levels are relatively high, and securing financing for future projects will be more expensive.  We're closely monitoring their ability to manage this increased cost of capital while maintaining their ambitious expansion plans."
