Their response to the drought, including water conservation initiatives, will be key to their future performance.  Regarding TikTok, the regulatory landscape remains their biggest challenge, with ongoing concerns about data privacy and potential bans in certain markets impacting user growth and advertising revenue.  The situation is fluid and requires constant monitoring."

It's difficult to predict the long-term impact of potential bans or stricter data regulations on their user base and revenue streams.  This uncertainty makes it a less attractive investment compared to CSMG3.SA, despite the latter's current challenges."
