Their recent investments in sustainable practices could be a significant long-term advantage, but the market's reaction to these investments remains to be seen. We need to carefully monitor their progress on cost-cutting and their response to competitive pressures."

However, its valuation currently appears slightly higher than some of its peers, reflecting the market's anticipation of future growth.  This higher valuation presents a risk, especially given the current economic uncertainty and margin pressures.  A more thorough comparative analysis, including a detailed valuation model, would be necessary to definitively assess its relative attractiveness compared to its competitors.  We should also consider the impact of any potential regulatory changes on the industry."
