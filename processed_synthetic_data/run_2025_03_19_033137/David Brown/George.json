While delivery numbers are encouraging, sustained profitability is crucial for long-term investor confidence.  The increased competition in the EV market is also a factor to consider.  Their R&D spending also seems higher than anticipated, which could impact short-term profitability.  What's your take on their guidance for the next quarter, considering the current macroeconomic climate and potential supply chain disruptions?"

The increased R&D spending is a strategic move, aiming for technological leadership and future product innovation.  However, the impact on short-term profitability needs careful monitoring.  We should also compare their performance against other key players in the Chinese EV market to gain a better perspective on their competitive positioning and market share.  The overall picture is complex, requiring a detailed analysis of various financial ratios and market trends."
