However, geopolitical uncertainty could impact that, so it's a calculated risk.  I'm also factoring in potential competition and regulatory changes in the European market which could slightly dampen the growth."

I've been running some similar models, and I see a similar potential, though my projections are slightly more conservative, around 8-12%, due to the increased volatility in the global economy and the potential for interest rate hikes impacting their investment portfolio.  I'm also keeping a close eye on their upcoming investor presentations for any hints about future strategies."

However, I'm particularly interested in Amer Sports' ability to navigate the supply chain challenges and their potential impact on long-term growth.  Their reliance on global supply chains makes them vulnerable to geopolitical risks, which is a significant factor in my assessment."

The supply chain disruptions are a significant headwind for Amer Sports, and their ability to mitigate these challenges will be crucial to their future performance.  Furthermore, Euractiv's relatively stable position might offer a degree of diversification within a portfolio, given the current market uncertainty.  However, the overall Eurozone economic outlook remains a significant factor influencing both companies' prospects.  We should closely monitor the evolving situation in the Eurozone and its potential impact on consumer spending and overall market sentiment."
