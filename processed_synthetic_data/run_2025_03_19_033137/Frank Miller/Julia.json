Tech is a bit sluggish, but consumer discretionary seems to be holding up relatively well.  Tesla's been bouncing around a bit, and I'm keeping a close eye on its earnings call next week.  What's on your radar this morning?"

Also, I've been looking at Amer Sports; their recent product launches seem promising, but I'm struggling to find a clear picture of their overall financial health and future projections.  Any insights you have on either would be great."
