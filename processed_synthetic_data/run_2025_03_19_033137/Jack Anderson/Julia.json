However, considering the current macroeconomic headwinds and the overall consumer spending trends, I believe their performance is relatively in line with expectations.  While the near-term outlook might be slightly subdued, we're maintaining a 'hold' rating on TPR for now, pending further analysis of their upcoming quarterly reports and overall market conditions.  The long-term prospects for Tapestry remain positive, given their strong brand portfolio and strategic initiatives.  However, we will be closely monitoring their performance in the coming months to assess the impact of the current economic uncertainty and adjust our rating accordingly.  We're also looking at their competitive landscape and any potential shifts in consumer preferences that could affect their market share."
