However, we've seen some pockets of strength in the financial sector, particularly among large cap banks.  This morning's focus is largely on the recent earnings releases, and I'd be interested in your initial thoughts before we delve into specific companies."

I'm particularly interested in hearing your analysis of Citigroup's (C) recent earnings report, given their significant exposure to the current economic climate.  Also, I'd appreciate your perspective on McKinsey & Company's performance, although I understand they don't have publicly traded stock."

How does this compare to your expectations, considering the current economic uncertainty and the general slowdown in consulting activity we've observed across the industry?  It would be helpful to compare their implied performance against other major consulting firms, if possible, even qualitatively."

While I don't have access to their internal numbers, anecdotal evidence and industry reports suggest they're outperforming many competitors.  Their focus on digital transformation and sustainability consulting seems to be paying off, allowing them to navigate the current economic headwinds more effectively than some of their peers.  This contrasts with the more pronounced slowdown experienced by some firms heavily reliant on traditional consulting services."
