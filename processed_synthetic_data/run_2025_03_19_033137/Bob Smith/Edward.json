However, their long-term prospects remain positive given their strategic investments in sustainable forestry practices and operational optimization.  We're seeing increased interest from ESG investors."

Considering the recent fluctuations in the Brazilian Real and the global economic uncertainty, what are the key risks and opportunities you see for Suzano in the next 12-18 months?  A detailed analysis of their cost structure, particularly in relation to energy prices and raw material sourcing, would also be valuable.  Finally, what's your price target for SUZ, and what are the key catalysts that could drive the stock price higher or lower in the coming quarters?"
