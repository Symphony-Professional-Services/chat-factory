I'm trying to figure out if this is just short-term noise or if there's something more fundamental at play.  Their loan growth seems decent, but their NIMs are under pressure, and the asset quality metrics are a bit concerning.  What's your take on their longer-term prospects, given the current macroeconomic environment in India and the competitive landscape within the Indian banking sector?  Are you seeing any similar trends in other banks in their peer group?  I'm particularly interested in their ability to maintain profitability given the rising cost of funds and potential for increased loan defaults."

                    "text": "I agree, the Q2 numbers for Bandhan Bank weren't stellar. The NIM compression is a definite concern, and the rising interest rate environment is putting pressure on their margins.  However, their loan growth is still relatively strong, suggesting underlying demand.  I think the asset quality concerns are worth monitoring closely, but I wouldn't necessarily write them off just yet.  It's a bit of a mixed bag, and I'm still trying to assess the long-term implications.  Much depends on how effectively they manage their cost of funds and navigate the economic headwinds."
