Have you considered the impact of recent Brazilian regulatory changes on their operations?"

Their Q2 earnings were decent, but the stock price hasn't reacted as strongly as I expected.  I'm curious about your take on their current valuation and future prospects, especially considering the ongoing uncertainty in the financial sector.  Are there any catalysts you foresee that could significantly impact their price in the near term?"

Their investment banking division is still facing headwinds, but their wealth management segment is performing well.  I think the valuation is relatively fair at the moment, maybe slightly undervalued depending on your time horizon.  I'm keeping a close eye on their upcoming investor presentations and any news regarding potential M&A activity. That could be a significant catalyst for price movement.  What's your current trading strategy for MS?"
