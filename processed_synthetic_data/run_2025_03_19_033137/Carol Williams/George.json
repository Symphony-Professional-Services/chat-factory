My analysis suggests Suzano's performance is largely in line with expectations, though the global economic uncertainty does present some headwinds.  Regarding Bank of America (BAC), their recent earnings reflect a robust performance, driven primarily by strong investment banking activity. However, we need to monitor potential interest rate hikes and their impact on lending and profitability.  A deeper dive into both companies' balance sheets and risk profiles is warranted before making any definitive conclusions."
