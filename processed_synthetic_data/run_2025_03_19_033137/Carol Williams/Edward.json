However, their long-term outlook remains positive, driven by their strong brand portfolio.  Iberdrola, on the other hand, exceeded expectations, largely due to increased renewable energy production and favorable regulatory changes. Their expansion into new markets also seems promising.  I'd be happy to discuss these in more detail if you'd like."

However, I think the market might be overreacting slightly.  Their asset quality remains relatively strong compared to some of their peers, and their management seems confident about future growth.  I've been looking at their cost-to-income ratio, which shows some promising signs of efficiency improvements."
