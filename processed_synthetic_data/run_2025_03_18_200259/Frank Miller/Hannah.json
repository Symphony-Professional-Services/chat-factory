Their performance in the luxury goods sector seems counter-cyclical to the current economic climate, and I'm trying to understand the drivers behind their seemingly strong results.  Specifically, I'm curious about their regional performance, particularly in Europe given the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, and their guidance for the upcoming quarters.  Also, I haven't found much readily available analysis on the impact of supply chain disruptions on their profitability.  Could you share your insights on these aspects, especially in comparison to other players in the luxury goods market (though I understand that's outside the scope of our current conversation)?  Finally, I'm also trying to assess the sustainability of their current growth trajectory given the potential for a broader economic slowdown."
