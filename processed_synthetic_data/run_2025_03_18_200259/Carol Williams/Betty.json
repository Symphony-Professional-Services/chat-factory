We've seen some decent volume in the sportswear sector lately, particularly in the Asian markets.  Generally, consumer discretionary is showing some resilience, despite the broader economic uncertainty.  What's on your radar today?"

I'm particularly interested in their diversification strategy and expansion into higher-margin segments.  What's your take on their long-term growth prospects, considering the current global economic climate and the competitive landscape in the athletic apparel market?"
