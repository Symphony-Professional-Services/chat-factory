So, considering JPMorgan Chase's performance against its projected targets and comparing it to other financial institutions in a similar position, how does this impact our current deal negotiations?  Specifically, I'm concerned about the valuation clause tied to their year-end performance.  Given the current market volatility and the slight dip in loan growth, I think we need to revisit the initial valuation.  Perhaps we could explore a tiered approach, adjusting the valuation based on their actual year-end performance against a revised set of benchmarks, factoring in the current economic uncertainty and the impact of interest rate fluctuations.  This would ensure a fairer deal for both parties, mitigating the risk associated with unforeseen market shifts and allowing for a more dynamic valuation that better reflects JPMorgan Chase's actual performance.  What are your thoughts on this approach?"
