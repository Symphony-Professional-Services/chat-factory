Citigroup's results were slightly below expectations, particularly in their investment banking division.  However, their consumer banking segment showed resilience.  Remitly, on the other hand, exceeded expectations, driven by strong growth in their international remittance services. I'm curious about your assessment of these two companies, considering their contrasting performances and the current market climate."
