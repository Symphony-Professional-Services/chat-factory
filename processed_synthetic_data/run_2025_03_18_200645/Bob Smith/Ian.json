Their recent earnings were solid, but I'm trying to gauge the longer-term outlook, especially considering the current geopolitical climate and its impact on oil prices.  Also, I'm looking at Alphabet (GOOGL) \u2013 their cloud business seems to be a strong growth driver, but the overall tech sector feels a bit overvalued to me right now.  I'm trying to figure out if GOOGL is a good long-term hold or if there's a better entry point."

However, the oil price volatility is always a concern.  I'd be cautious about overexposure there.  Regarding GOOGL, I agree the valuation is a point of discussion.  Their Q3 earnings will be crucial in determining future movement.  The cloud segment is definitely a key factor."

I need to do more research on their competitive landscape and the potential impact of any regulatory changes.  I'm also considering the possibility of a pullback before making a decision.  What are your thoughts on the potential for a correction in the tech sector in the near future?"

It really depends on the Q3 results and the overall market sentiment.  For now, I'd suggest closely monitoring both TTE and GOOGL, and perhaps consider a staggered entry for GOOGL if you're bullish on the long term.  Let's reconnect next week to discuss further."
