Compared to competitors like Citigroup and Bank of America, JPM's performance is quite competitive, particularly in their trading and investment banking divisions.  I think the recent dip presents a good buying opportunity, especially considering their strong balance sheet and future outlook.  Of course, there's always inherent risk, but I believe the potential reward outweighs it in this case."
