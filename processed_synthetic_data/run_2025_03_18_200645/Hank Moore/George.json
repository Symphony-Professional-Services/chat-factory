Their performance is still strong overall, but we need to factor in potential future disruptions. Allianz, on the other hand, presents a more complex picture.  Their exposure to various global markets makes them vulnerable to economic downturns, and their recent investments in renewable energy haven't quite yielded the expected returns. We need to carefully analyze their risk profile before making any significant commitments."

Their exposure to the Eurozone is another factor to consider, given the current economic uncertainty. We should also look at their long-term strategic plans and how those align with our investment goals.  A thorough sensitivity analysis is crucial before we finalize any deal involving Allianz."
