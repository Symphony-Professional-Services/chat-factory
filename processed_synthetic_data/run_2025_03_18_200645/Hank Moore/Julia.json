However, I'm concerned about potential regulatory hurdles and the overall risk profile compared to other investments BAC might be considering.  Do you have any data on the potential deal structures BAC might pursue, considering their recent investment strategies and appetite for risk in the Brazilian energy market?  Any information on potential competitors vying for a stake in Equatorial Energia would also be helpful.  Finally, what's your take on the long-term valuation of EQNR3.SA, considering the volatility of the Brazilian Real and the potential impact of global energy price fluctuations?"
