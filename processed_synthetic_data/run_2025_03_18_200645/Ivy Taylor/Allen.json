However, the broader indices are holding relatively steady.  We've seen some interesting developments in the Brazilian market, particularly concerning interest rate adjustments and their potential impact on utility companies.  Have you had a chance to review the latest macroeconomic forecasts for Brazil?"

Their recent earnings report was somewhat underwhelming, and I'm particularly interested in your assessment of their long-term growth prospects, considering the ongoing privatization efforts and the current regulatory environment in Brazil."

Compared to other utilities, their performance is lagging, but the potential for growth post-privatization is significant.  However, it's a high-risk, high-reward scenario."
