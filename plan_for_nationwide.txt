1. Read through docs and understand what can be ported directly into config file 
2. Identify what the taxonomy will look like
3. IF Taxonomy = Good and Config = Good:
    - run and produce sample data
   IF Taxonomy = Bad and Config = Good:
    - See what changes need to made to taxonomy processing enginer / taxonomy file structure
   IF Taxonomy = Good and Config = Bad:
    - See what changes need to be made to the way the generator structures the conversations / update config file
   IF Taxonomy = Bad and Config = Bad:
    - well shit will need to do some refactoring

ALSO CLEAN TF UP THIS REPO lol (maybe rewrite a lot of it)
