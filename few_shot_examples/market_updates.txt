        "text": "Broad risk-off sentiment.  Even Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are feeling the heat. Investors rotating out of tech and into defensives.  Keep an eye on financials like JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS)."

        "speaker": "1",
        "text": "Financials are indeed holding up better.  JPM and GS slightly up on rate hike expectations.  Energy sector also showing resilience, with TotalEnergies and Eni outperforming.  Sector rotation in full swing."

        "text": "Global inflation concerns are universal.  Allianz and Eni in Europe, similar to JPM and GS in the US, showing relative strength due to sector dynamics.  Market needs clarity on central bank actions."

        "text": "Agreed.  Volatility is likely to remain elevated.  Focus on portfolio resilience and quality companies with strong balance sheets.  Companies like Blackrock and Allianz might be good defensive plays."
